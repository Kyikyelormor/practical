// Write a JavaScript function to convert an amount into coins.
// Write a function to find the area of a given rectangle (try with params).
// Write a function called `transmogrifier`. This function should accept three arguments,
// which you can assume will be numbers. Your function should return the "transmogrified" result.
// The transmogrified result of three numbers is the product of the first two numbers,
//  raised to the power of the third number.
